    <h5>Lightbot Reflection</h5>
    <p>Lightbot is similar to a computer because it takes inputs and makes outputs from them. Although lightbot is a simple representation of the way a computer works they both act similarly in the way that they take button presses and translate them into movement or a action. They are different in the sense that lightbot only has a few commands compared to a computer who had many. </p>

    <p>2.It is a good idea to program is smaller increments because it will be easier to find an error that way. Short code helps to target problems in code</p>
    <p>1.A professional programer had to figure out a code by trial and error similar to how people have to figure out how to math problems that they don't know how to solve.</p>
    <p>4. A computer with 2 cores can run more that 2 programs because the switch very quickly between tasks and work on all the programs at once. Fast task switching is the professional term for the when a single core works on multiple tasks.</p>
